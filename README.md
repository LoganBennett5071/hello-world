Code practice for github

As the president and only programmer of a FIRST Robotics Team, I decided it was probably time for me to learn how to use GitHub. If anyone is reading this, trying to figure out how to use GitHub, google how to use GitHub, then click the GitHub hello world tutorial link. It looks like it will be very helpful.
